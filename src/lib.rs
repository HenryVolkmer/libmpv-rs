//! This crate provides abstractions for libmpv of the mpv media player. It is guaranteed
//! that no `Client` or `EventIter` is used after their parent exited.
//!
//! Libmpv requires LC_NUMERIC to be C. This is set once the first `Parent` is created.
//! Do not change this during the usage of this crate.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! See the 'examples' directory in the crate root.
